HOW TO RUN THE APP

This app was not designed to run build variants on release but rather on debug only.
To run the app pull down the project on android studio by going to 
VCS -> Check out from version control -> Github
on the Clone repository window you would want to test first to see if the 
connection is successful before cloning, leave the defaluts, unless you want
to change the dirctory name and parent directory path and click on clone.
You might have to install additional plugins or additional support libraries
to be able to build gradle successfully.
